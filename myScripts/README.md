## About my Script

After a little study on the concepts of Linux, I decided to start writing a few useful scripts to aid me work smarter and put my knowledge to use.

The following are the script contents and description:

1. 3g - runs a git add all, displays git status, commits with a generic message and pushes.

2. a - Simply lists all files in the working directory in long format, including hidden files.

3. c_template - Generate a c starter file with basic header and main functions.
