### About Making This Calculator

This is the first challenge I undertook in C programming.

I had written a calculator before in python, but it was a breeze since python is a pretty beginner friendly language.

However, I must confess i struggled a lot on C, but I was determined to do it with little to no help.

# My Lessons Learnt:

1. Most important lesson that this task re-emphasized was pseudocode: stating your program in plain english.

2. Order cannot be over-emphasized: Lesson one above can go a long way to ensuring this.

I hope to add more functions/functionality to this calculator as time goes on.
